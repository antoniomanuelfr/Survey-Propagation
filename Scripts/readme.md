# Scripts folder

In this folder there are some scripts that I used in order to automate the process of generating random formulas, checking which formulas are satisfiable, etc

- `check_formulas.sh`: This script will use the [Glucose](https://github.com/mi-ki/glucose-syrup) algorithm to calculate how many formulas are satisfiable inside a directory.
- `gen_formulas.sh`: This script will generate formulas using [this](https://github.com/jgirald/satgenerators) random formula generator
